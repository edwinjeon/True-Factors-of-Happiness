# 📊 True Factors of Happiness – Tableau Visualization Project

What truly makes people happy? Is it income, education, status — or something deeper?  
This Tableau-based project explores the **real drivers of happiness**, challenging common assumptions of economic factors through **psychological** and **evolutionary** perspectives.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights
- **3-part dashboard** exploring global, personal, and cultural drivers of happiness.
- Integrates **GDP, survey data, and personality metrics** from multiple international sources.
- Uses **Evolutionary Psychology** as a framework to interpret findings.
- Fully interactive on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/weongyu.jeon/viz/TrueFactorsofHappiness/Page1).

## 🧠 Project Background
While global reports often tie happiness to **Money**, **Evolutionary Psychology (EP)** suggests humans evolved to prioritize:
- **Social connection**
- **Purposeful roles**
- **Individual autonomy and respect**

This dashboard examines:
- **Cross-country economic indicators**- GDP per Capita data
- **Survey data from ESS Round 11**- Cultural and personality metrics (e.g., extraversion, trust)

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Merged GDP & World Happiness Report data (2011–2024)
   - Extracted 11 key variables from ESS11
2. **Visualization in Tableau**
   - Built 6 dashboard for 3 sections with different analytical lenses
   - Compared economic correlations vs. social/psychological correlations to happiness
   - Interpreted patterns through an Evolutionary Psychology lens

## 📊 Dashboard Sections
### **Part 1: Money and Happiness**
- Global trend: Higher GDP ↔ higher happiness  
- But time-series data (USA, India, Panama) shows happiness doesn’t always increase alongside income growth.

### **Part 2: Perception and Meaning**
- **Income feeling** (perceived comfort) matters more than actual income.
- **Purposeful roles** (students, homemakers, military) show high happiness regardless of pay.

### **Part 3: Evolutionary Roots**
- **Social activity & frequent meetings** strongly predict happiness.
- **Cultural values** like trust and respect for differences correlate with higher happiness.
- Suggests traits like **extraversion** and **freedom** align with evolved needs.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
✅ Income and education help — but only up to a point  
✅ Feeling valued, connected, and trusted drives stronger happiness gains  
✅ Cultural and social factors match our evolved psychological needs better than pure wealth
